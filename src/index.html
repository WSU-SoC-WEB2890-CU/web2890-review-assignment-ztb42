					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p class="lh-lg">
						My name is Zackary Byington. I was born in Layton, Utah
						on August of 2001. I lived in Roy, Utah until 1st grade,
						then moved to West Haven just a couple miles away. I've
						always been technologically savvy and I am glad to say I
						have not changed my major too many times in realizing
						that coding was what I wanted to do in the future.
					</p>
					<h2>Schooling</h2>
					<p class="lh-lg">
						I started coding during my sophomore year of high
						school. I was in a program called "Project Lead the
						Way", which was a STEM program that focused on
						engineering. I took a "Principles of Engineering" class
						my freshman year of high school and I enjoyed it enough
						that I was planning on continuing in that field until I
						heard about a new program that was starting up called
						Interactive Computer Arts (ICA). That sounded really
						interesting so I took an ICA class the next year, which
						just ended up being CS 1010. After that, Computer
						Science was my focus and I made it my top priority. I
						took more CS classes throughout the rest of my high
						school years and continued to enjoy it.
					</p>
					<p class="lh-lg">
						When I started college at Weber State University, my
						plan was to continue in the Computer Science program. I
						worked through several of my general education classes
						and started to take CS courses again. The first CS
						classes I took at Weber State were CS 2350 and CS 2550.
						I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Cs 2350 especially and I
						decided to look into the Web UX Major where I would get
						a more focused look into web design. It sounded exciting
						and quite promising and I am currently in my first
						semester as a Web student. I'd like to think it's going
						pretty well. I plan to continue the program until I get
						my Bachelor's degree.
					</p>
					<h2>Experience</h2>
					<p class="lh-lg">
						I have experience working with several coding languages,
						with most of my experience being in Java, Python,
						HTMl/CSS/Javascript, SQL, and React. I also have
						experience working in tech support for over a year now.
						I'm currently working at the Weber State IT Service Desk
						and I enjoy helping people learn more about how
						computers function in that aspect. It has especially
						helped me learn the "ins and outs" of multiple operating
						systems and I have become proficient in working with Mac
						and Windows both. I have also worked with several Linux
						distros. I'm sure I will continue to get better at
						programming and working on the backend of things as my
						time goes on, and I look forward to it.
					</p>
					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p class="lh-lg">
						Many of the other skills I have developed have come as a
						result of my childhood and my serving a mission for the
						Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I spent two
						years serving others in the Kansas City area and I
						learned quite a bit about myself and how to work with
						other people. I have never had an issue with social
						interaction and I think I'm very proficient in working
						with others. It is not often that I have a rough time
						getting along with others and making friends. Another
						thing I learned from my mission was hard work. We were
						up early every day and working late and it taught me a
						lot in that aspect. As a missionary, I lived with
						another person my age and spent all day with them as
						well. It really taught me patience and I can tell that
						patience has translated into my working with others
						since I have been home.
					</p>
					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
					<p class="lh-lg">
						During my free time, I like to play video games, watch
						movies and TV shows, and spend time with friends and
						family. I play a lot of games with friends that I met at
						my current job and it has been a lot of fun. I built a
						PC in the summer of 2022 with my friends which was also
						a big learning experience for me. I have never worked
						with hardware too much so that was very cool. I have
						also been able to troubleshoot some issues on my PC
						since then which I think is fun. I also love music and I
						spend a lot of my time listening to music while I'm
						doing other things. I like most types of music and I
						listen to many genres, such as rap, R&B, sad pop, lofi,
						and country. I play the piano, which has always been a
						good outlet for me when I'm struggling with things.
						Music just speaks to me and helps me to cope with
						everything going on in life.
