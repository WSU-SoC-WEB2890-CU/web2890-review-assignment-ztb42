1: Added functionality to navbar links
I felt that this adds a feel of legitimacy to the site and it wasn't difficult.

2: Removed several unnecessary sections
For my portfolio personally, I felt that there was just too much going on with the page, so I decided to remove a few sections, especially since I will be adding two new ones anyways.

3: Changed "Services" to "Qualities"
Services didn't seem to fit the vibe of my page. Maybe some people left it but I decided to change it to qualities that I have that employers may look for.

4: Added more padding to the text inside "Qualities"
Needed more spacing so the text wasn't getting cut off.

5: Changed "Testimonials" to "Quotes"
I don't really have any clients or specific people that I would have testimonials from, and I thought having a quotes section gave my site some more personality.

6: Changed the phone number in the navbar to a contact button which opens my modal, a new section. 
I would rather not have my phone number out there for everyone to see anyways, but I thought having a contact button in the navbar made more sense for me.

7: Removed "Learn more" buttons in my Qualities section.
I had no idea what to link them to, and they felt unnecessary, although they did look nice.

8: Added a background color to the Qualities on smaller breakpoints to separate them.
It looked confusing when you were on smaller screens and you couldn't tell what the images were supposed to correspond to.

9: Changed the links at the bottom of the page to only include Github and LinkedIn.
I just thought that would be better for me, since I don't want all my information out there for grabs. I also added real links to them so you can view my github and linkedin if you're so inclined.

10: Changed the icon in the left of the navbar using Photoshop to match the colors of the rest of my theme.
It looked really out of place before this so I took it upon myself to change the color of orange to match mine.
